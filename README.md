# sensoredweb #

## Introduction ##
This project is a small scale implementation of [sensor web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor_web), a distributed network of arbitrary sensors and actuators.
The project is loosly based and largely inspired by the work at Carnegie Mellon University on [Sensor Andrew](http://sensor.andrew.cmu.edu/about)
